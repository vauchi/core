//! Long-tail domain dispatch for `PlatformAppEngine`.
//!
//! Phase B7 of `_private/docs/problems/2026-04-28-collapse-vauchi-platform-into-app-engine/`.
//! Replaces ~150 thin pass-through wrappers on `VauchiPlatform` with a
//! single typed entry point on `PlatformAppEngine`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! engine.dispatch_domain_command(DomainCommand::GrantConsent {
//!     consent_type: MobileConsentType::Crashlytics,
//! })?;
//! ```
//!
//! The R3 hybrid (B1-CLASSIFICATION.md, accepted 2026-04-28) keeps
//! Recovery / Emergency Broadcast / Device Linking as direct typed
//! methods on `PlatformAppEngine` (B2/B3/B4); the long-tail collapses
//! into the [`DomainCommand`] enum here. Each domain is added in its
//! own batch MR rather than committing all 150 variants at once — this
//! keeps reviewer scope tractable and lets the typed-method pattern
//! validate before the enum bloats.
//!
//! The first batch is **Consent** (5 variants, this MR). Subsequent
//! batches will extend [`DomainCommand`] and [`DomainCommandResult`]
//! with new variants without breaking existing call sites — UniFFI
//! treats added enum cases as additive on the binding side.
