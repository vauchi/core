The app idea:
1. the goal of the app is to create an updatable contact card 
2. users can exchange the contact card on their module device only in the real world (meaning they need to be together physically)
3. A user can add and remove contact info on his own devices at will.
4. A user can control what contact information about him other users can see on their end
5. A contact info can be a phone number, a social media account (link or id), an email, a physical address, these contact infos should be relatively small data
6. messages can not be exchanged
7. if possible avoid a central server, keep comunications e2e encrypted, make sure attackers can not access data
8. if a user adds or changes a contact info, users that he is in contact with and can see this info see the updated information
9. the app should work on iOS, android  but there should also be  pc/mac/linux gui clients
10. If there is need for a central server, users should be asked to contribute on a voluntary bases.
11. the data the app handles should be considered sensible
