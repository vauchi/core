# Vauchi Core

A privacy-focused library for exchanging contact information that stays up-to-date.

## What is Vauchi?

Vauchi solves a simple problem: when you exchange contact details with someone, that information becomes outdated the moment either of you changes your phone number, email, social media, or address. Worse, social media platforms keep users captive by implicitly threatening them with losing their contacts if they leave.

With Vauchi, your contacts automatically receive updates when you change your information - securely and privately. No central server sees your data; everything is end-to-end encrypted.

## Key Benefits

- **Always Current** - Contacts receive updates when you change your details
- **Privacy First** - End-to-end encryption; only your contacts see your information
- **Selective Sharing** - Control which contacts see which fields
- **Works Offline** - Changes sync when connectivity returns
- **No Account Required** - Exchange via QR code, no signup needed

## Project Status

The core library is feature-complete with 267 tests passing. Ready for platform integration (mobile apps, CLI tools).

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical design and [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md) for code organization.
